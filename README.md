# Cipher-Solver
This project is a cipher solver written in C used to solve challenges from MisteryTwister, a crypto challenge contest. Basic cipher algorithms like Caesar, ROT13, Vigenere, ... will also be implemented.

I am currently working on the following challenge : **The Lady Liz Challenge**, submitted by Elijah Cross on 2025-02-10. No solution has been proposed yet (2025-02-15).

You can find the challenge [here](https://mysterytwister.org/challenges).
